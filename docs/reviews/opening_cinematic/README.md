# Opening cinematic review

[Watch the full cinematic with music](opening_cinematic.mp4).

This capture follows the production title's **New Game** path through the
complete opening, an Esc pause/resume demonstration and the ordinary bedroom
handoff. All images are rendered by the game with the runtime assets. Temporary
journey and settings files leave ordinary saves untouched. Effects are muted.

The soundtrack is reconstructed from the exact shipped OGGs and observed
production mixer commands because the headless SDL driver has no audio loopback.
It includes the actual fades and the preserved music position across the pause.
It is not a separate musical arrangement. `verification.json` records the
observed route, single repeating leitmotif request and frozen-world checks.
